Today I learnt that what is First Normal Form and how do we identify it.
What are the 3 different approaches in which we can solve this. 


Then I started with Binary search.
1) How we calculate upper bound and lower bound.
2) Solved a coding problem ( Valid Perfect Square).

For better understanding I am attaching my notes in here in the form of pdf. So please go through it once.
